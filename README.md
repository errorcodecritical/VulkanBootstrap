# A bare-minimum approach to rendering a triangle with Vulkan & GLFW
---
Created as a learning exercise, following the tutorial from https://vulkan-tutorial.com.
I will be releasing a more concise and documented version in the near future.

The minimum dependencies required by this project are:
- The Vulkan SDK, specifically the Vulkan headers and static library;
- GLFW 3.0, for setting up a window and Vulkan surface;
- GLSLC, for shader compilation;
